# Git Extensions

## Introduction

This is an early preview version of GitExtensions with the most wanted features and bug fixes merged, such as combined diff (for reviewing merge conflicts), left branches tree panel, multiple commits cherry-picking, branches/commits comparision, force with lease, showing real line number in the diff and etc.

Please don't submit any issue to the official team as it's a MOD version. You can report issues [Here](https://github.com/EbenZhang/gitextensions/issues/new) if you have any concern. 

If you want to contribute a fix or feature, please make sure your branch is based off the official master branch, so it can be merged to both official and this MOD.

## OS Support
- Windows: 7SP1 and above
- Linux/Mac: requires [Mono 5.0](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) and above, however the support is limited due to limited support of WinForms by Mono
